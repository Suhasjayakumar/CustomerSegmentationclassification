**Customer Segmentation Analysis - SQL Project**

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer data using SQL to extract meaningful insights related to demographics, spending behavior, and professional backgrounds. Various SQL techniques, including indexing, ranking, and temporary tables, have been used to optimize data retrieval and analysis.

## Objectives
- Retrieve and filter customer data based on specific attributes.
- Analyze spending patterns and professional segmentation.
- Implement advanced SQL techniques for optimized query performance.

## SQL Techniques Used
### 1. Data Retrieval & Filtering
- Selected customers who are **Female, Graduated, and work in Entertainment**.
- Retrieved the **top 5 youngest customers** using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.
- Filtered customers with a **Work Experience greater than the average**.

### 2. Aggregation & Grouping
- Counted customers in each **Profession** using `GROUP BY`.
- Computed the **average age per Spending Score category**.
- Identified the **Profession with the highest average Work Experience**.

### 3. Ranking & Sorting
- Ranked customers based on **Work Experience** using `RANK() OVER()`.
- Retrieved the **top 3 most common professions** using a **Common Table Expression (CTE)**.

### 4. Advanced SQL Optimization
- **Created an Index** on the `Profession` column to improve search performance.
- **Utilized a Temporary Table** to store high spenders for quick access.
- **Categorized customers** with Family Size greater than 5 based on Spending Score.

## Key Insights
- **Spending Score Distribution:** Customers were grouped into spending categories to understand purchasing behavior.
- **Professional Segmentation:** Certain professions had higher spending tendencies.
- **Family Size Impact:** Larger family sizes correlated with different spending behaviors.
- **Query Optimization:** Indexing and temporary tables improved query execution speed.

## Future Scope
- Implement **Machine Learning models** to predict customer spending behavior.
- Integrate the analysis with **BI tools** for interactive visualizations.
- Optimize database storage and indexing for **better performance at scale**.
